## Frontend Test instructions

This coding challenge consists of four deliverables, the prompts are inside the `/prompts` folder were copied as received:

1. Navigation hover
2. Gradient background
3. Website header
4. To do application

For each folder, use the preview.jpg file as a reference and create a html / css / js version using the index.html (welcome to create external css / js file).

Here are some overal instructions for each exercise:

- Please don't use any framework building platform for these tests.
- Please do a pure css / js version first.
- Make considerations for Accessibility and Responsiveness.
- Use images when only necessary. SVG's are preferred.
- If you don't have a font, choose a similar one using google fonts.
- If you don't have images, you are welcome to swap them out for a similar image from pexels.com.
- Finally, re-do the exercise using the Svelte & Tailwind frameworks.
- Bonus: if you are able to add tasteful CSS animations to elements.

Specific instructions:

1. Navigation hover

   - Recreate a centered navigation similar to this with hover/active animations changing color and underlining the text.

2. Gradient background logo

   - Recreate this gradient background with a centered logo.

3. Website header

   - Recreate this web design as close as possible. Responsive is a bonus.

4. To do application

   - Recreate this web design as close as possible. Please create a javascript application making the to do application interactive. You are welcome to do a version using your preferred JS framework as well.

## Delivery instructions

### Live version

A live version for the solution is temporarily available at [https://revance-test.rigoli.dev](https://revance-test.rigoli.dev) password protected:

```text
user: svitla-revance
password: frontend-test
```

This live version will be available until **feedback is returned** or until **May 10th**. The intention is to have an easy preview for the challenge.

If there's any problem with this you can ask me to take it down at [marcos@rigoli.dev](mailto:marcos@rigoli.dev).

### Deliverable

This repository would probably be delivered by a compressed file.

A private repository for the solution will also be available at [https://github.com/rijuma/revance-svitla-frontend-test](https://github.com/rijuma/revance-svitla-frontend-test) <i>(please share a github account to give access to it)</i>.

#### Run locally

To run this code locally please follow these steps:

1. If you don't have the files already, clone this repository locally, for example by using the [github CLI](https://cli.github.com):
   ```text
   git clone git@github.com:rijuma/revance-svitla-frontend-test.git
   ```
   Then, get into the folder by:
   ```text
   cd revance-svitla-frontend-test
   ```
2. Using a terminal on the extracted/cloned folder, install the dependencies by running:
   ```text
   npm install
   ```
   > **Note:** Check **npm** documentation [here](https://www.npmjs.com) if needed.
3. Start the server by running `npm run dev` and open the browser at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
4. You should be able to see a home page with the details on the frontend test and a list of links to open each solution.
   > **Note:** To stop the server, just hit `Ctrl + C` in the terminal. Make sure to stop the server before closing the terminal window, otherwise the server process will remain open in the background.

I've enjoyed working on the challenges. Looking forward to working with you soon.
